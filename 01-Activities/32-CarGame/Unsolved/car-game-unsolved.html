                // Second, alerts the user w/ the new calculated mileage 
                // Third, alerts user that the car has added so many miles to the point that it needs a tune-up
                // Then, this.isWorking property value changes from true to false, making the car no longer work
                    // This makes it so that the user can no longer add milage to the car until the tuneup function is executed

              // The 4 functions represent processes that the car must be able to execute in order to work like a real car, metaphorically 
              // In order to play the car game, the car must be able to do these things inside of the object {} 
                // b/c the execution of these functions is what makes it a working car to the game parameters 


      // FUNCTIONS
      // ==============================================================================

      // TO DO: Log all of our car's current stats to the console.
      function reWriteStats() {
        console.log("Make: " + car.make);
        console.log("Model: " + car.model);
        console.log("Color: " + car.color);
        console.log("Milage: " + car.mileage);
        console.log("Is Working: " + car.isWorking);
        console.log("------------------------------");
      };
          // This function updates the statisitics (mostly the mileage & isWorking) to the console log so the developer can see how the user is playing the game 
              // Calling the object.property outside of the object {} in a separate function allows the stats to update each round 


      // MAIN PROCESS
      // ==============================================================================

      // A while loop makes more sense here than a for loop, because we don't know how long the user will want to play the game
      // This loop will end when the user presses Cancel, thus setting the letter variable to "null"
        // While loop is set to execute when the letter variable up top is valued to be undefined
      while (letter !== null) {
        // Prompt user to input a letter
        letter = prompt("Type 'h' to honk, 'd' to drive to work, 'w' to drive around the world, or 't' to get a tuneup.");
        
        // TO DO: Call the different car methods
        if (letter === "h") {
          car.honk();
          reWriteStats();
        }

        else if (letter === "d" && car.isWorking) {
          car.driveToWork();
          reWriteStats();
        } 
        else if (letter === "w" && car.isWorking) {
          car.driveAroundWorld();
          reWriteStats();
        }
        else if (letter === "t") {
          car.getTuneUp();
          reWriteStats();
        }
      }
          // In the while loop, each if/else if statement calls a function from w/in the object - mutating the values w/in the object 
            // Then, after calling a function from w/in the object, calls the reWriteStats frunction from outside the object parameters, which updates the object values to the console
            // && operator => logical operator used to determine the logic between variables or values 
                // && = true -> then if statement is executed, if not, then both conditions are not satisfied & if statement will not run 
                // isWorking is set to true until the around the world function executes, then isWorking is set to false until tuneup function is executed 
          // This while loop will run every round of the game until user exits the browser 
            // mileage property will continue increasing as game runs repeatedly
