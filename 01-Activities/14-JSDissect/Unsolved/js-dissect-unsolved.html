        // This concatenates a string value w/ the integer
          // This concatenation solely adds a digit (w/ the value of 2) to the string value that the user was prompted to type in from line 52
            // This concatenation = string + integer =/= not a math equation 

      // Works as expected - math is involved this time

        // parseInt makes the value of the variable catAge an integer 
          // Now, the catAge variable can be added to 2 to equate to a math problem - based on the numerical value of catAge rather than the string value
